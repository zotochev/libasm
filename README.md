# libasm

## Build
**requirements**: nasm, gcc, make

To build run `make` in the root of the project. This will create small library `libasm.a` written on assembly language (intel x86)

## Tests
To see how library `libasm.a` works I prepared some tests in directry `tests`.

To run tests run `make tests` in the root of the project
